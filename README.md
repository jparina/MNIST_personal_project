Project Title: Handwritten Digit Classifier Web Application

Project Description:
I am proposing a machine learning project that involves building a web application capable of classifying handwritten digits. The goal of this project is to develop a neural network model that can accurately recognize and classify handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains images of handwritten digits and serves as a standard benchmark for image classification tasks.

The project will involve training a neural network model on the MNIST dataset, with a focus on understanding the model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics. Once the model is trained and achieves satisfactory performance, I will integrate it into a web application built using Django (backend) and React (frontend). The web application will provide an interactive canvas where users can draw digits, and the application will use the trained model to classify the drawn digits in real-time, displaying the predictions to the user.

Educational Goals:

- Gain hands-on experience in training a neural network model for image classification.
- Understand the fundamentals of neural network architecture, including layers, activation functions, and loss functions.
- Learn how to preprocess and prepare image data for training a machine learning model.
- Explore techniques for evaluating the performance of a classification model.
- Develop proficiency in building a web application using Django and React.
- Implement a user-friendly interface for real-time interaction with the machine learning model.
- Apply software engineering best practices to integrate the machine learning model into the web application.

Future Extension:
As a potential extension to this project, I plan to explore the possibility of training the model to segment and classify multiple handwritten digits drawn on a single canvas. This will involve additional challenges, such as image segmentation and multi-digit recognition, and will provide an opportunity for further learning and exploration in the field of machine learning.

This project aligns with my interests in machine learning and web development and will allow me to apply the skills and knowledge acquired during Code Platoon.
